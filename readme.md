## Magento 2 Admin search

This module intends to improve Magento 2 admin global search.

I would like to be able to type in terms like "sku test-sku" and have
that particular product oped directly without needing to go the product grid
and filtering by sku.

Similarly I would like to be able to open orders by typing increament id, or purchase date or customer email

Same goes for customers, I would like to open up customers by typing there email in admin search


At least for now, this is just a fun side-project.
